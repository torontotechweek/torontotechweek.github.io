This conversation invites us to explore digital burnout, attention fatigue, and the possibilities of being fully here - with ourselves, each other, and our surroundings. Together, we‚Äôll reflect on how Toronto‚Äôs tech culture might help shape new norms around presence, pace, and pause. \n\n__\n\nFive days. Five public spaces. Five big questions. \n\nCommon Code is a free pop-up conversation series hosted by Reset that invites Toronto‚Äôs tech community to gather in public spaces to explore questions at the intersection of tech, trust, and togetherness in Toronto. Each day, we bring a new question to life in a different neighbourhood that invites Town Hall-like dialogue and debate on topics related to surveillance, sovereignty, safety and more. An unplug valet will be available at each pop-up for anyone wishing to go phone free.",

                "description": "‚ÄãMany people are turned off by the prospect of using social media to achieve personal or professional goals. Whether it's the tone of the online arena or the act of reducing oneself to an abstracted profile, it can be an unpleasant and alienating space to occupy. \n\n‚ÄãBeing Online is a response to this aversion, a workshop on translating self-reflection into an online persona that feels genuine, maintains itself, and results in real world achievements. It is not a session about maximizing impressions, gaining followers, or gaming algorithms. Instead participants will be exploring how their personal goals and strategies can translate into tactics that feel natural and resonate with people on a genuine level. Among the topics we'll cover are: the concept of self as explored by philosophers and graphic novelists, the use of classical rhetorical strategies in 280 characters or less, and case studies on successful real world applications. \n\n‚ÄãAbout the speaker\nDan Seljak is a marketing professional who has been working in the \"built environment\" for the past decade. Between helping architects, landscape designers and planners win work, his multi-media project Another Glass Box serves as an outlet for his more civic-oriented projects. His focus is on getting people excited about participating in civic life and restoring agency to citizen actors by delivering clear, informative, and (hopefully) fun messaging about how to engage communities and municipalities.",

                "description": "Public space is changing - with smart tech offering efficiency, artificial intelligence, and real-time data. But what‚Äôs the cost of convenience, and who controls the code behind the infrastructure? This dialogue explores how we can embed values like sovereignty, accountability, and collective stewardship into the design of tomorrow‚Äôs public spaces.\n\n---\n\nFive days. Five public spaces. Five big questions. \n\nCommon Code is a free pop-up conversation series hosted by Reset that invites Toronto‚Äôs tech community to gather in public spaces to explore questions at the intersection of tech, trust, and togetherness in Toronto. Each day, we bring a new question to life in a different neighbourhood that invites Town Hall-like dialogue and debate on topics related to surveillance, sovereignty, safety and more. An unplug valet will be available at each pop-up for anyone wishing to go phone free.\n",
