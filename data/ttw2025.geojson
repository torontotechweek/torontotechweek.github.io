                "description": "​Many people are turned off by the prospect of using social media to achieve personal or professional goals. Whether it's the tone of the online arena or the act of reducing oneself to an abstracted profile, it can be an unpleasant and alienating space to occupy. \n\n​Being Online is a response to this aversion, a workshop on translating self-reflection into an online persona that feels genuine, maintains itself, and results in real world achievements. It is not a session about maximizing impressions, gaining followers, or gaming algorithms. Instead participants will be exploring how their personal goals and strategies can translate into tactics that feel natural and resonate with people on a genuine level. Among the topics we'll cover are: the concept of self as explored by philosophers and graphic novelists, the use of classical rhetorical strategies in 280 characters or less, and case studies on successful real world applications. \n\n​About the speaker\nDan Seljak is a marketing professional who has been working in the \"built environment\" for the past decade. Between helping architects, landscape designers and planners win work, his multi-media project Another Glass Box serves as an outlet for his more civic-oriented projects. His focus is on getting people excited about participating in civic life and restoring agency to citizen actors by delivering clear, informative, and (hopefully) fun messaging about how to engage communities and municipalities.",

The venue will determine the capacity.  I regularly host similar events such as https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7291098359568703488/  via TrueNorthCTO.   It will be self-funding (and not-for-profit) via registration fees and/or perhaps some sponsorship (the venue will be sponsored/donated).  I do not anticipate a 'presentation format'.  Perhaps a fire-side chat along on a pre-determined theme of growth and transformation in a Canadian context.\n\nPrevious venues have included:  AWS, Wealthsimple, Float, Index Exchange, One Eleven, Rose Rocket, Snowflake, RLDatix, MaRS\n\nPresently determining panel participants & venue (either Rose Rocket or Index Exchange)",

The rapid emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has accelerated this debate.\n\n​​The fireside chat will cover a broad range of topics, including:\n\n​​- Canada’s place in the AI revolution\n- Do LLMs understand language in the same way as we do?\n- Reasons for optimism\n- ​​Risks of AI\n- Is digital intelligence better than analog intelligence?\n\n​Frontiers of AI is a day of programming on June 25 delivered in partnership with the University of Toronto (U of T), MaRS and The Vector Institute, featuring a hands-on showcase of Canadian innovation that is shaping the global future of AI — take part in engaging conversations, demos, workshops and networking.

This gathering opens space to rethink how we create, share, and consume content in public - especially in moments or movements where safety and trust matter most. What would it take to document with care, and create norms that protect both presence and power?\n\n---\n\nFive days. Five public spaces. Five big questions. \n\nCommon Code is a free pop-up conversation series hosted by Reset that invites Toronto’s tech community to gather in public spaces to explore questions at the intersection of tech, trust, and togetherness in Toronto. Each day, we bring a new question to life in a different neighbourhood that invites Town Hall-like dialogue and debate on topics related to surveillance, sovereignty, safety and more. An unplug valet will be available at each pop-up for anyone wishing to go phone free.\n",

Drawing from real-world examples in his Olympia app, Obie will outline four ways AI is reshaping the development process—from code helpers to smart subsystems—while sharing practical patterns like “Narrow the Path” and “Multitude of Workers.” This hands-on talk is a guide to not just coding faster, but coding less and coding smarter.\n\n​Attendance is open by application, with acceptances granted on a rolling basis until capacity is reached. Don’t miss this opportunity to learn, connect, and gain actionable insights into the future of AI-driven development.\n\nWe are officially part of Toronto Tech Week 2025, a weeklong citywide collection of events to connect and celebrate the builders.
